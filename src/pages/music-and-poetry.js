          <p> Why do I write poetry? It started as a habit in middle school. For me, poetry is how I express curious thoughts in 
          curious formats. There's a thousand small stories that I want to tell through words. 

          </p>
          <p> 
          Favorite poems/poem collections: "Remember" (Christina Rossetti), "Goblin Market" (Christina Rossetti), "The Rhodora" (
            Ralph Waldo Emerson),
            <em>Veinte poemas de amor y una canci√≥n desesperada</em> (Pablo Neruda)

          <p>  Whether quietly mouthing the lyrics to the newest pop hit at my desk or belting out solo Adele concerts in the shower, 
            I am constantly singing. 
          </p>
          <p>My favorite songs capture fleeting snapshots of daily life; when I hear Fight Song, I am immediately reminded of busy 
            summer days spent eating persimmons and running errands with my mother. 
          </p>
          <p> 
              
         The memories evoked from different songs stay with me long after the first time I hear them. To my friends, crooning Spanish pop
           hits bring back memories of loud karaoke nights at our houses. When I sing, I can almost taste the emotion behind every word. 
         </p>
          <p>
           
           Singing is the bridge into my personal photo album, where thousands of half-forgotten melodies will forever dance in my mind.
